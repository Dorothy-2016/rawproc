<ul>
	<li>If you're processing a raw file, just plan to add the 2.2 gamma right off the bat, then apply black/white point
		to make the image tones fill the tone range.</li><br>
	<li>While the program is named rawproc, it works well editing JPEGs, TIFFs, and PNGs too.</li><br>
	<li>rawproc tools are mostly multithreaded and compiled with as much optimization as is tolerable.  However, 
		Denoise and Sharpen are slow tools that become unbearably slow with big images; consider using them 
		after resizing the image smaller.</li><br>
	<li>Curves work best if the change is small.  Avoid shallow slopes, as they collapse large tone (rich) ranges into very
		small (dull) ones.</li><br>
	<li>My personal experience with sharpening is that it is most useful after a reduction resize, as image resolution
		is usually lost even with the best algorithms.  After a resize, add a sharpen tool and bump it to 1, note the
		improvement.  In most cases values of 2 or greater have little marginal benefit at the expense of introducing
		halos around the edges.</li><br>
	<li>You can apply tools in any order you wish, but some orders are less beneficial than others.  This is why other
		programs such as DarkTable and RawTherapee hard-code the order, but I am more charitable to your whims while 
		less interested in your complaints...  :D</li><br>
