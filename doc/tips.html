<ul>
	<li>If you're processing a raw file without color management, just plan to add the 2.2 gamma right off the bat, then apply black/white point
		to make the image tones fill the tone range.  I finally broke down and added a 
		configuration paramter (input.raw.default) to automatically apply a list of commands to raw files (after it asks you 
		if you want to do so), "gamma:2.2 blackwhitepoint" would be useful.</li><br>
	<li>While the program is named rawproc, it works well for editing JPEGs, PNGs and TIFFs too. </li><br>
	<li>rawproc tools are mostly multithreaded and compiled with as much optimization as is tolerable.  However, 
		Denoise is a slow tool that becomes unbearably slow with big images; consider using it 
		after resizing the image smaller.  Alternatively, try the libraw wavelet_denoise parameter; it is pretty quick and produces quality denoise...</li><br>
	<li>Curves work best if the change is small.  Avoid shallow slopes, as they collapse large (rich) tone ranges into very
		small (dull) ones.</li><br>
	<li>My personal experience with sharpening is that it is most useful after a reduction resize, as image clarity
		is usually lost even with the best resize algorithms.  After a resize, add a sharpen tool and bump it to 1, note the
		improvement.  In most cases values of 2 or greater have little marginal benefit at the expense of introducing
		halos around the edges.</li><br>
	<li>All the tools are multithreaded.  The default is to use all the available cores, e.g., tool.sharpen.cores=0, but 
		the specific number can be specified for each tool in the Properties list.  Using a negative number uses
		the max available minus that number, which can be useful for reserving a core for UI processing, e.g., 
		tool.denoise.cores=-1.  This can be handy with certain operating systems to allow interactive work to continue
		while an image tool is processed.</li><br>
	<li>The Re-open menu selection was implemented specifically for use with the LibRaw parameters.  The raw file can
		be opened with a set of parameters, and if something needs to be adjusted/added/omitted, the Properties parameter
		can be modified and the image re-opened to apply it.</li><br>
	<li>When you edit properties, use the filter to isolate the relevant ones.  For example, just type "curve" in the 
		filter, and only the parameters with "curve" in the name will be displayed.  Makes it easier to find 
		parameters.</li><br>
	<li>rawproc as of 0.7 doesn't have a white balance tool, but you can use per-channel curves to do the correction.
		You can get an approximation of a white tone by zooming to 100%, running the mouse over a known white
		area and observing the RGB values.  It helps to have the display.rgb.scale set to 256.  Look for either
		the red or blue channel to be observably different from the other two, then add a curve for that channel and 
		drag the upper limit control point down the right side to reduce, across the top to add, in order to bring
		the channel values up or down to the other two channels.  You can also usually see the channel offset in the
		histogram; drag the upper limit control point down or accross to bring the upper part of that channel's 
		histogram plot in line with the other two.</li><br>
	<li>You can apply tools in any order you wish, but some orders are less beneficial than others.  This is why other
		programs such as DarkTable and RawTherapee hard-code the order, but I am more charitable to your whims while 
		less interested in your complaints...  :D</li><br>
	<li>Want to convert a color negative image?  Open it in rawproc and apply the following tools:
	<ol>
		<li>crop (to the relevant image)
		<li>blackwhitepoint:red
		<li>blackwhitepoint:green
		<li>blackwhitepoint:blue
		<li>curve (drag the 255,255 point over to 0,255, then the 0,0 point to 255,0)
	</ol>
	Pretty close... Oh, make sure you set tool.blackwhitepoint.auto=1 beforehand, so the blackwhitepoint
	tool computes the bounds.</li><br>
