<h3 id="Group">Group</h3>
<p>Allows updating the selected group.  Two ways:
<ul>
<li>File Select: Allows one to select a toollist file to populate the group. The filename
is appended to the group item in the command list.</li>
<li>Update Group: Allows one to edit a group command list. The command string in the 
edit box is edited, and then the Update Group button is pressed to change the group and
replace the processed image.  If the updated group was populated from a toollist file,
the filename is removed from the group item in the command list.</li>
</ul>
