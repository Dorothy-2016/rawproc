<h3 id="Rotate">Rotate</h3>
<p>Rotates the image, for straightening the horizon or a dominant vertical line.  The slider rotates the preview
image in .1 degree increments; use the star button to apply the rotation to the full image.  Note the black fill
where the rotated image does not fill the rectangle; if you plan to crop the image, save that tool for after 
rotation to also remove the black fill.</p>
<p align=center><img src=rotate.png></p>
<p>Note: rotate is implemented using the FreeImage routine, so it is not multithreaded, and will run slower than other tools.</p>
