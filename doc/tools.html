<h2 id="ImageManipulations">Image Tools</h2>

<p>At the top of each tool pane, at the left is a checkbox that enables/disables the tool; use this to 
toggle on/off the tool's effect without having to delete and re-insert it.  Also in this area, selected
tools have copy and paste buttons, so a tool's command and parameters can be copied and pasted into
other instances of the same tool.  And also in this area, tools that allow application to specific 
RGB channels have a channel selector.</p>

<p>Most tools have a reset button, that restores the default value to each associated parameter.</p>

<p>Most of the tools are based on a curve-generated lookup table; if applicable, the curve used to 
make the tool is illustrated in the descriptions below.</p>

<p>A note about the rawproc curve:  In both the curve tool display and the lookup table generation, the 
curve control points are specified as values between 0.0 and 255.0.  However, the curve control points and 
lookup values are floating point numbers, and are converted to the image tone range of 0.0 - 1.0 for application.</p>
