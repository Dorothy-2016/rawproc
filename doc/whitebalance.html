<h3 id="White Balance">White Balance</h3>
<p>Provides a selection of methods to white-balance the image:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Auto:</b> Computes red and blue multipliers based on the "gray world" algorithm, which
assumes an image tones average to middle gray.</li><br>
<li><b>Patch:</b> A point in the image can be selected by holding the shift key and clicking
on a point in the picture panel.  The patch size used to compute the multpliers is specified
in tool.whitebalance.patchradius.</li><br>
<li><b>Camera:</b> Applies the multipliers retrieved from the raw file's metadata. If the image
contains a metadata LibrawMosaiced=1, the multipliers are applied using a whitebalance operator
specifically written to apply R, G and B to the mosaic array.  If LibrawMosaiced=0 (changed by applying
the demosaic tool), the multipliers are applied using the regular whitebalance operator.  These 
multipliers are relevant to the raw, linear image; the colors will be very off if applied to anything 
other than the raw linear image.  Additionally, for the unmosaiced application, adjusting the camera 
multipliers in this mode will revert to three-color whitebalance, and the image just won't look nice. </li><br>
<li><b>Original:</b> The channel multipliers, if no other method is specified.  These can be
changed in the multiplier edit boxes.  The edit boxes support mousewheel changes, where 
shift-mousehwheel changes in 0.01 increments, ctrl-mousewheel changes in 0.1 increments, and 
plain mouswheel changes in 0.001 increments.  If Auto, Patch, or Camera is selected and a 
multiplier is manually altered, the tool is de-selected.</li><br>
</ul>
