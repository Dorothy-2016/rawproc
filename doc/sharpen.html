<h3 id="Sharpen">Sharpen</h3>
<p>Sharpens the image edges.  This tool is really a digital unsharp mask, which actually increases the contrast 
of the edges, more appropriately known as acutance.  The algorithm used is a simple 3x3 convolution kernel, 
adjustable in strength from 1 to 10 in 0.1 increments.  The 0 value is no-sharpen.</p>

<p>The kernel used to apply the sharpening is displayed.  Of note:
<ul>
	<li>The algorithm that performs the convolution takes the pixels in the 3x3 area surrounding the pixel to be
	modified, multiplies each by the corresponding kernel value (including the center pixel), and replaces the 
	pixel value with the sum of those multplications.</li>
	<li>The matrix that produces no-change, or the 'identity matrix', has 1.0 as its center value and 0.0 for the
	surrounding values.</li>
</ul>	
<p>I've found the most effective use of this tool is to sharpen reduced-sized images to restore the 
acutance lost in pixel interpolation; before version 1.0 I've been using 1 for this purpose, but now
I'm going to use the 0.1 increments to see if there's value in lower strengths.</p>
