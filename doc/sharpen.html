<h3 id="Sharpen">Sharpen</h3>
<p>Sharpens the image edges.  This tool is really a digital unsharp mask, which actually increases the contrast 
of the edges, more appropriately known as acutance.  The algorithm used is a simple 3x3 convolution kernel, 
adjustable in strength from 1 to 10.  The 0 value is no-sharpen, so you can easily compare it and the lowest 
sharpening value by just rocking the mouse thumbwheel.</p>

<p>I've found the most effective use of this tool is to sharpen reduced-sized images to restore the 
acutance lost in pixel interpolation; using the 
minimum sharpen setting is usually good enough for this purpose.</p>
