<h3 id="Workflow">How to use rawproc</h3>
<p>Basically, you open an image, apply one or more tools to change it, then save it.  You can apply tools in any order you wish, but there are some 
considerations to consider:</p>
<br>
<ul>

<li>As of 0.5, rawproc does intput-to-output color management.  You can turn this off in the configuration parameters, but you want to make sure you've
picked appropriate raw input parameters in order to start with a sRGB colorspace image.  You can adjust gamma either in the raw parameters or with the
gamma tool, but I recommend doing so with the raw parameters when using color management so that the attached ICC profile properly reflects the input image.
The color management enable parameter is applied when an image is opened, so it can be switched prior to opening the next image.</li>

<li>Some tools depend on the image being in a certain state.  Gamma, for instance, should only be used on a "linear-scale" image, which is what most 
raw camera files contain.  Gamma is used to expand the tone values to a scale more along the lines 
of what humans perceive; camera sensors record "linearly", that is, in a much smaller scale.  Open a camera raw image, note that it's pretty dark. 
Look at the histogram, and you'll see that the pixels are all bunched up at the bottom of the tone scale. Add the gamma tool, and they spread out.  So,
gamma should be used on raw images, applied first.  However, as of version 0.5, rawproc does color management, where the ICC profiles contain 
tone response curves appropriate to the color space, so you'll probably want to work gamma there rather than with the rawproc tool<br></li>

<li>After applying gamma to a camera raw image, you'll notice that the tones usually don't use the entire tone range from black to white.  Add a black/white point
tool and adjust the sliders so the image tone range expands to fill the available range in the histogram.  I use these tools so frequently on raw images 
that I hard-coded the default gamma to 2.2 and made an autocorrect option for the black/white point tool, where it'll read the histogram and pick appropriate 
black and white point settings automatically.  You can turn it off in the config file.  So, when I open a camera raw, I just apply gamma then black/white point 
without thinking about it, and go from there.  Usually, the third tool is a curve, a very flexible tool for modifying the tone range for contrast, etc.<br></li>

<li>Some tools are slow.  Particularly denoise, followed by sharpen.  I usually don't use either until after I resize the image for web posting, and they 
both run more quickly on fewer pixels<br></li>

<li>If you're going to rotate the image to straighten it out and crop for composition, do the rotate first, then when you crop you'll also be taking care of 
the black irregular borders around the rotated image.<br></li>

</ul>

<p>When you save an image, rawproc saves the list of applied tools and their parameters in the image metadata.  You can re-apply these tools to the original 
image by using Open Source to open the saved image; instead of opening the saved image, rawproc will open the original image and re-apply each tool in order, 
with the saved parameters.  You can change around the tools and re-save to the same image, or to another one by changing the file name.  rawproc doesn't have 
a Save As file option by design; you have to pick the save file name each time.</p>

<p>rawproc's name belies its flexibility; it can be used to edit any JPEG, TIFF, or PNG image.  Raw or otherwise, once you open an image, it's just an array
of pixels...</p>

<p>One of the main reasons I wrote rawproc was to make all the tools I used for image editing work well on both 8-bit and 16-bit images.  When you open any image file, 
the tone values for each pixel are converted to floating point numbers, which means the values range from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white).  Depending on 
the host, the internal floating point representation is either 32-bit float (Linux) or 16-bit half (Windows).  Even the half format provides 
plenty of room for tone manipulation to avoid posterization.</p>

<p>Having a desktop shortcut to rawproc (selectable option in the Windows install package) is handy for quick opening of images; with your file explorer, you 
can review images and open the one you want to edit by dragging it to the rawproc desktop icon.</p>

<p>The configuration file contains a boatload of settings for you to tweak to your convenience.  You need to save the file, then restart rawproc for them to take
effect.  You can find the path of the configuration file on the Help->About dialog.</p>
