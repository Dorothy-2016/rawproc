<h3 id="Workflow">How to use rawproc</h3>
<p>Basically, you open an image, apply one or more tools to change it, then save it.  You can apply tools in any order you wish, but there are some 
considerations to consider:</p>
<br>
<ul>

<li>Color Management, or Not?  You need to make this choice before you open your image, as it's set then and not changeable until you open another image.  In
the configuration parameters, this is done with input.cms; 1=on, 0=off.  Here
are the key considerations in rawproc for each:</li>

	<ul>

	<li>input.cms=1: You need to specify profiles for display (display.cms.displayprofile) and output (output.*.cms.profile).  Your input image is (at present) assumed to contain 
an ICC profile representative of its color space.  For raw images, you need to specify both an output colorspace (output_color= or colorspace=) and gamma (there are three ways do do gamma)
as LibRaw delivers the image with a profile, except if output_color=0 (linear).  rawproc has internal profiles for prophoto, srgb, wide, and adobe; srgb is somewhat okay for 
the display profile if you don't have a calibrated profile for your monitor, but you really need to do a calibrated profile if you want color management to work for you.
For output, srgb is appropriate for JPEGs to be displayed; for TIFFs, consider saving in one of the working profiles, preferrably the one you opened the image with, for subsequent
editing in, say, GIMP.  You can also choose to specify a .icc file for display or output; Elle Stone's profiles work well: https://github.com/ellelstone/elles_icc_profiles</li>

	<li>input.cms=0: If you choose to not use color management, you need to read the input image already converted to something that looks decent on the screen.
That's likely to  be srgb, which you can probably assume is already in effect for JPEGs.  If you're opening a raw file, you need to set that prior to opening, like this: 
input.raw.parameters=colorspace=srgb;gamma=srgb.  The image will be displayed and saved without color tranformation, and no profile will be inserted in the output image.</li>

	</ul>


<li>After opening a camera raw image, you'll notice that the tones usually don't use the entire tone range from black to white.  Add a black/white point
tool and adjust the sliders so the image tone range expands to fill the available range in the histogram.  I use these tools so frequently on raw images 
that I hard-coded the default gamma to 2.2 and made an autocorrect option for the black/white point tool, where it'll read the histogram and pick appropriate 
black and white point settings automatically.  You can turn it off in the config file.  So, when I open a camera raw, I just apply gamma then black/white point 
without thinking about it, and go from there.  Usually, the third tool is a curve, a very flexible tool for modifying the tone range for contrast, etc.<br></li>

<li>Some tools are slow.  Particularly denoise, followed by sharpen.  I usually don't use either until after I resize the image for web posting, and they 
both run more quickly on fewer pixels<br></li>

<li>If you're going to rotate the image to straighten it out and crop for composition, do the rotate first, then when you crop you'll also be taking care of 
the black irregular borders around the rotated image.<br></li>

</ul>

<p>When you save an image, rawproc saves the list of applied tools and their parameters in the image metadata.  You can re-apply these tools to the original 
image by using Open Source to open the saved image; instead of opening the saved image, rawproc will open the original image and re-apply each tool in order, 
with the saved parameters.  You can change around the tools and re-save to the same image, or to another one by changing the file name.  rawproc doesn't have 
a Save As file option by design; you have to pick the save file name each time.</p>

<p>rawproc's name belies its flexibility; it can be used to edit any JPEG, TIFF, or PNG image.  Raw or otherwise, once you open an image, it's just an array
of pixels...</p>

<p>One of the main reasons I wrote rawproc was to make all the tools I used for image editing work well on both 8-bit and 16-bit images.  When you open any image file, 
the tone values for each pixel are converted to floating point numbers, which means the values range from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white).  Depending on 
the host, the internal floating point representation is either 32-bit float (Linux) or 16-bit half (Windows).  Even the half format provides 
plenty of room for tone manipulation to avoid posterization.</p>

<p>Having a desktop shortcut to rawproc (selectable option in the Windows install package) is handy for quick opening of images; with your file explorer, you 
can review images and open the one you want to edit by dragging it to the rawproc desktop icon.</p>

<p>The configuration file contains a boatload of settings for you to tweak to your convenience.  You need to save the file, then restart rawproc for them to take
effect.  You can find the path of the configuration file on the Help->About dialog.</p>
