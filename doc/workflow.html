<h3 id="Workflow">How to use rawproc</h3>
<p>Basically, you open an image, apply one or more tools to change it, then save it.  You can apply tools in any order you wish, but there are some 
considerations to consider:</p>
<br>
<ul>

<li>Some tools depend on the image being in a certain state.  Gamma, for instance, should only be used on a "linear-scale" image, which is what most 
raw camera files contain.  Gamma is used to expand the tone values to a scale more along the lines 
of what humans perceive; camera sensors record "linearly", that is, in a much smaller scale.  Open a camera raw image, note that it's pretty dark. 
Look at the histogram, and you'll see that the pixels are all bunched up at the bottom of the tone scale. Add the gamma tool, and they spread out.  So,
gamma should be used on raw images, applied first.<br></li>

<li>After applying gamma to a camera raw image, you'll notice that the tones usually don't use the entire tone range from black to white.  Add a black/white point
tool and adjust the sliders so the image tone range expands to fill the available range in the histogram.  I use these tools so frequently on raw images 
that I hard-coded the default gamma to 2.2 and made an autocorrect option for the black/white point tool, where it'll read the histogram and pick appropriate 
black and white point settings automatically.  You can turn it off in the config file.  So, when I open a camera raw, I just apply gamma then black/white point 
without thinking about it, and go from there.  Usually, the third tool is a curve, a very flexible tool for modifying the tone range for contrast, etc.<br></li>

<li>Some tools are slow.  Particularly denoise, followed by sharpen.  I usually don't use either until after I resize the image for web posting, and they 
both run more quickly on fewer pixels<br></li>

<li>If you're going to rotate the image to straighten it out and crop for composition, do the rotate first, then when you crop you'll also be taking care of 
the black irregular borders around the rotated image.<br></li>

</ul>

<p>When you save an image, rawproc saves the list of applied tools and their parameters in the image metadata.  You can re-apply these tools to the original 
image by using Open Source to open the saved image; instead of opening the saved image, rawproc will open the original image and re-apply each tool in order, 
with the saved parameters.  You can change around the tools and re-save to the same image, or to another one by changing the file name.  rawproc doesn't have 
a Save As file option by design; you have to pick the save file name each time.</p>

<p>rawproc's name belies its flexibility; it can be used to edit any JPEG, TIFF, or PNG image.  Raw or otherwise, once you open an image, it's just an array
of pixels...</p>

<p>One of the main reasons I wrote rawproc was to make all the tools I used for image editing work on both 8-bit and 16-bit images.  When you open a raw 
camera file, the tone values for each pixel are given in a 16-bit range, which means the values range from 0 (black) to 65535 (white).  You want to do most of
your editing while the color values are in this range, as you have much smaller differences between each tone as you stretch contrast, etc.  To see the 
difference, open a camera raw image, apply gamma, black/white point, and save it twice, first as a TIFF (.tif), then as JPEG (.jpg).  The .tif and .jpg files will
look the same when opened, but the .tif tones are 16-bit while the .jpg tones are 8-bit.  Now, if you edit each image identically and look at the 
histogram, you'll see spaces start to develop in the .jpg histogram because 8-bit tones only have 256 possible values between 0 (black) and 255 (white). This is called
"posterization", because the image starts to look more like a poster and less like a photograph.  So, you want to do as much editing as possible while the 
image is 16-bit; when you save it to JPEG, it'll automatically convert to 8-bit because JPEG doesn't support 16-bit tones.  This is why a lot of folks save the 
basic edited image to TIFF, to use as the master.  This also has the advantage of being quicker to open than the raw file, because the raw conversion doesn't 
have to be re-done.
</p>

<p>You can tell whether an image is 16- or 8-bit by right-clicking any of the applied tools and selecting Image Information.  You also get other helpful information
such as image width and height, and basic exposure information.  rawproc doesn't manage image metadata, or EXIF data, very well, so consider getting the extremely
useful exiftool utility to inspect, modify and copy image metadata.</p>

<p>Having a desktop shortcut to rawproc (selectable option in the Windows install package) is handy for quick opening of images; with your file explorer, you 
can review images and open the one you want to edit by dragging it to the rawproc desktop icon.</p>

<p>The configuration file contains a boatload of settings for you to tweak to your convenience.  You need to save the file, then restart rawproc for them to take
effect.  You can find the path of the configuration file on the Help->About dialog.</p>
