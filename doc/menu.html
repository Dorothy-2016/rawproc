<h2 id="MenuActions">Menu Actions</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>File->Open:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can select a file to open.  If you select 
a camera raw file to open, a radio box with options is enabled; these correspond to the libraw options, but
if you're opening a camera raw for processing, you want to stick with Default.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Open Source:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can select a file to open.  But, what then 
happens is that the selected file is inspected for a rawproc command list; if one is found, 
the original file specified in that list is opened instead, and the rest of the manipulation command list is
applied to the opened image.  The original image has to be in the same directory as the selected image.
This takes a bit of time, so be patient.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Save:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can specify a filename to save the image.  The
image type is determined by what extension you give to the file name, .jpg, .tif, or .png.  Save will
always bring up a dialog, whether you're saving to the same file or a new one.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Exit:</b>  Does what is says.  There is no prompt to save an unsaved image, so be careful.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->Cut/Copy/Paste:</b> These menu items work on the list of tools applied to the image, so you can 
cut/copy a selected command and paste it elsewhere in the list.</li><br>

<li><b>Add->(tool):</b> Selecting one of the tools from this menu adds it to the Commands list,
after the selected tool.  See below for more enlightenment on the various image tools.</li><br>

<li><b>Help->Show Command:</b> Brings up a dialog box showing the command list that would be saved
to the image EXIFif you saved the file at that point.</li><br>

<li><b>Help->About:</b> Right now, this shows the rawproc description and version and the wxWidgets and FreeImage 
information for the included versions, as 
well as the directory containing the rawproc.conf file read at startup. </li><br>

</ul>
