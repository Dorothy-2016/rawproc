<h2 id="MenuActions">Menu Actions</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>File->Open:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can select a file to open.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Re-Open:</b> Re-opens the previously opened file.  Helpful if you're trying various raw
parameters.  If the previous open was Open Source, the source image will be opened and its command
parameters applied, including the raw parameters with which the image was originally built.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Open Source:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can select a file to open.  But, what then 
happens is that the selected file is inspected for a rawproc command list; if one is found, 
the original file specified in that list is opened instead, and the rest of the manipulation command list is
applied to the opened image.  The original image has to be in the same directory as the selected image.
This takes a bit of time, so be patient.  When finished, the sourced filename is displayed first in the 
title bar, then the file created from the source in parens.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Save:</b> Brings up a dialog box in which you can specify a filename to save the image.  The
image type is determined by what extension you give to the file name, .jpg or .tif.  Save will
always bring up a dialog, whether you're saving to the same file or a new one.  When finished, the 
originally opened file name is still displayed in the title bar, but the saved file name is added, in 
parens.</li><br>

<li><b>File->Exit:</b>  Does what is says.  There is no prompt to save an unsaved image, so be careful.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->Cut/Copy/Paste:</b> These menu items work on the list of tools applied to the image, so you can 
cut/copy a selected command and paste it elsewhere in the list.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->Properties:</b> Opens a dialog box for editing all of the configuration parameters from rawproc.conf.
Parameters can be added or deleted with the Add and Delete buttons.  Changing a parameter requires
clicking in the value cell, keyboard editing the value, and typing Return.  Clicking Dismiss will also save a
parameter in the middle of editing.  Changed parameter values are saved to the .conf file immediately upon 
change.  Parameters are presented in sorted order, but the original order and
formatting of the .conf file is preserved. The filter box allows culling the list to find selected parameters; 
typing a string immediately culls the list to those that contain the string.  See the Configuration topic for
more information on the available parameters.</li><br>

<li><b>Edit->EXIF:</b> Opens a dialog box containing the output of running exiftool on the opened image file.
Provides a more comprehensive listing of the image metadata than the Image Information menu in the command
pop-up menu.  A path to exiftool must be present in exif.command in the Properties list.</li><br>

<li><b>Add->(tool):</b> Selecting one of the tools from this menu adds it to the Commands list,
after the selected tool.  See the sub-topics for more enlightenment on the various image tools.</li><br>

<li><b>Add->Tool List:</b> Opens a file selector on the directory specified in app.toollistpath (or the 
current working directory if app.toollistpath is empty) to allow selection of a file containing a list
of tools to be inserted in the processing chain below the currently selected tool.  The list in the file
has one tool per line, like this:
<pre>
resize:800
sharpen:1
</pre>
The insertion of the tools cannot be undone.  Make sure you have the right tool selected before inserting
the tool list.  Tool list files can be created with any text editor.  If a property needs to be
set to a certain value, specify it with a set: command, which will only apply for the toollist.
Here's a complete example, turns a color negative image into a normal positive:
<pre>
set:tool.blackwhitepoint.auto=1
blackwhitepoint:red
blackwhitepoint:green
blackwhitepoint:blue
curve:rgb,0,255,255,0
whitebalance:auto
</pre>
</li><br>

<li><b>Help->Show Command:</b> Brings up a dialog box showing the command list that would be saved
to the image EXIF if you saved the file at that point.</li><br>

<li><b>Help->About:</b> Brings up a dialog box that shows the rawproc description and version, versions of
all the included libraries, the pixel format, the directory containing the rawproc.conf file read at startup, 
and optionally the build date, depending on how rawproc was compiled. </li><br>

</ul>
