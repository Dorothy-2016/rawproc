<p>Just run the .exe file you downloaded.  The installer will install rawproc just 
like any other program.  It'll also put a rawproc.conf file in your c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\rawproc\ 
directory; you can change various configuration particulars in this file before running rawproc. A choice will be
presented for you to keep your previous rawproc.conf; however, please review the Configuration topic for 
information on new configuration parameters.  And, if you chose 
to do so in the install process, it'll put a shortcut on your desktop.  I recommend doing this, as you can quickly open pictures 
by dragging them from your Explorer window to the rawproc icon.  And, with the -c switch you can 
now make multiple desktop shortcuts, all pointing to the same rawproc but to different configuration files.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If  you're reinstalling rawproc and you want to keep your old settings, it would be a good idea to 
copy rawproc.conf from the APDDATA directory, let the installer install the new rawproc.conf, and hand-edit in your
previous settings.  One day, I'll implement a .conf merge function...</p>

<p>The AppImage of rawproc available on the github Releases page should run on most mainstream Linux distributions.  Just
download it to a convenient location, and run it as you would any other program.  The AppRun script I'm now
using seems to allow the executable to find the configuration and help files just as if the application were 
running natively.</p>

<h2 id="Compilingrawproc">Compiling rawproc</h2>

<p>If you want to try compiling rawproc, there's a wiki page on the topic in the github repo.  It's not 
a trivial exercise, especially if you're either compiling it on Windows, or just including LensFun</p>
