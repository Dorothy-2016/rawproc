<h2 id="Installingrawproc">Installing rawproc</h2>

<p>Just run the .exe file you downloaded.  The installer will install rawproc and the .dll files it needs just 
like any other program.  It'll also put a rawproc.conf file in your c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\rawproc\ 
directory; you can change various configuration particulars in this file before running rawproc.  And, if you chose 
in the install process, it'll put a shortcut on your desktop.  I recommend doing this, as you can quickly open pictures 
by dragging them from your Explorer window to the rawproc icon.</p>
