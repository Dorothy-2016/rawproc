<h2 id="Installingrawproc">Installing rawproc</h2>

<p>Just run the .exe file you downloaded.  The installer will install rawproc just 
like any other program.  It'll also put a rawproc.conf file in your c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\rawproc\ 
directory; you can change various configuration particulars in this file before running rawproc. A choice will be
presented for you to keep your previous rawproc.conf; however, please review the Configuration topic for 
information on new configuration parameters.  And, if you chose 
to do so in the install process, it'll put a shortcut on your desktop.  I recommend doing this, as you can quickly open pictures 
by dragging them from your Explorer window to the rawproc icon.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If  you're reinstalling rawproc and you want to keep your old settings, it would be a good idea to 
copy rawproc.conf from the APDDATA directory, let the installer install the new rawproc.conf, and hand-edit in your
previous settings.  One day, I'll implement a .conf merge function...</p>
