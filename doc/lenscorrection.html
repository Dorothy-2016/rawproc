<h3 id="LensCorrection">Lens Correction</h3>
<p>The lens correction tool offers the corrections implemented by the lensfun library: chromatic abberation,
vignetting, and distortion.  Additionally, autocropping is provided to select the largest proper rectangular
image from distortion correction.

<p>The lensfun database is expected at its standard locations.  If the database is not found when the tool
is added, an error dialog informs of the fact and the tool is not added to the chain.</p>

<p>The tool's default is to use the image metadata vaules for camera and lens, if found.  If either cannot
be found, values can be selected manually by clicking the "Select Camera" or "Select Lens" buttons; a dialog 
is provided to select from the available database entries.  The list can be culled with the Filter entry; if
a string is typed in the entry, the list is filtered to display only the database records that contain the 
string.</p>

<p>Note: The processing command stored in the output image metadata will only contain camera or lens names 
if they're selected manually; otherwise, the original image metadata is the assumed source.
