<h3 id="Crop">Crop</h3>
<p>Allows selection of a portion of the image to be the new image.  In the display pane, northwest and southeast 
corner points adjusts the crop window to suit; dragging in the crop rectangle moves it around the image.</p>
<p align=center><img src=crop1.png> <img src=crop2.png></p>
<p>The northwest and southeast control points have two different behaviors; the northwest point (yellow rectangle) maintains 
the original image aspect ratio; the southeast point (red circle) allows free-form change of the crop box.  You switch 
from one to the other simply by dragging the appropriate control point.</p>
<p>Note: crop is implemented using the FreeImage routine, so it is not multithreaded, and will run slower than other tools.</p>
<p>Tip: Drag the Commands box out of it's docked position to make it bigger for more precise control of the crop window.</p>
