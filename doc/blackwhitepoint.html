<h3 id="BlackWhitePoint">Black/White Point</h3>
<p>With a curve defined as (0.0, 0,0, 255.0, 255.0), the sliders move the respective endpoint (0.0, 0.0 for 
black, 255.0,255.0 for white) left or right.  This allows you to 'contrast-stretch' the image, making the 
pixel values use the full range available.  When you add Black/White Point to the commands list, this tool 
attempts to find the ends of the image's tone range; if you don't like what it did, you can manually work 
the sliders to a more satisfactory position.

<p>BlackWhitePoint is applied to all three channels by default, but can be applied to a single channel 
using the drop-down selector.

<p>A configuration file parameter (tool.blackwhitepoint.auto) is available to make this tool do an 
automatic adjustment when you 
add it.  The algorithm is based on walking each end of the histogram until a value greater than or equal 
to a set percentage of the largest "tone bucket", hard-coded to 5% (0.05).  The separate black and white 
thresholds are configurable, if you find one or both to consistently clip out data you want to retain.  
You can also simply just slide the sliders to where you want after auto does it's thing.  Note that 
"auto" is not the saved parameter, rather the result parameters are in the command line applied 
to the saved image</p>

<p>The ReCalculate checkbox enables automatic re-calculation of the auto-calculated black and white points
whenever the tool is re-processed.  This is useful if upstream tools are added or modified.  Note that, 
if you've set the points manually, checking this box will do away with those settings replace them with 
auto-calculated settings.
