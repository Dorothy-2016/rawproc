<h3 id="BlackWhitePoint">Black/White Point</h3>
<p>With a curve defined as (0.0, 0,0, 255.0, 255.0), the sliders move the respective endpoint left or 
right.  This allows you to 'contrast-stretch' the image, making the pixel values use the full range available.  When you
add Black/White Point to the commands list, this tool attempts to find the ends of the image's tone range; if you don't like what it did,
you can manually work the sliders to a more satisfactory position.

<p>A configuration file parameter (tool.blackwhitepoint.auto) is available to make this tool do an 
automatic adjustment when you 
add it.  The algorithm is based on walking each end of the histogram until a value greater than or equal 
to a set percentage of the largest "tone bucket", hard-coded to 5% (0.05).  The separate black and white 
thresholds are configurable, if you find one or both to consistently clip out data you want to retain.  
You can also simply just slide the sliders to where you want after auto does it's thing.  Note that 
"auto" is not the saved parameter, rather the result parameters are in the command line applied 
to the saved image</p>
