<p>When started, rawproc will present you with a window containing three panes:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Display: The right-hand window, contains the image being manipulated.  There is also a thumbnail 
	window in the top-left corner that will toggle visible or hidden.
	You can toggle the thumb modes with either the 't' key, or double-click on the thumb.  For the 
	display image, you
	can zoom in or out of the image using the mousewheel, or toggle 100%/fit by double-clicking
	the image.</li><br>

	<li>Commands: The top-left-hand window, contains the list of tools applied to the image.  You
	can select a tool to mess with by left-clicking it.  Right-clicking a tool 
	brings up a pop-up menu from which you can either display EXIF and image data or delete the
	tool. The checkbox beside each tool is to
	select that tool result for display; this can be done separate from selecting the tool to
	mess with its parameters.  This is extremely useful to compare the results of different tools,
	as the display is switched from image to image without having to reprocess, at the expense of
	memory.  It works well for 16MP images, but I'm not sure how it'll scale to larger ones.</li><br>
	
	<li>Histogram: Standard RGB histogram.  It can be zoomed in with the mouse thumbwheel, and panned
	by dragging with the mouse. The default scale is 256 bins; this can be changed with the 
	histogram.scale parameter in the Properties list, for instance, to set 65536 for sixteen-bit 
	scaling.</li><br>

	<li>Parameters: The bottom-left-hand window, contains the tools for changing the tool 
	selected in the Commands pane.  These are mostly sliders that you can manipulate with either
	a mouse or a touchscreen implement (stylus, or your finger).  Most tools have a reset button.  
	Sometimes, especially with Linux/GTK,
	the parameter tools won't display when you select a command; just resize the window slightly and
	they'll appear.  Something about Refresh() I need to figure out...</li><br>
</ol>

<p>You can drag the Commands and Parameters windows from their initial positions and dock them to various sides of the 
rawproc window, or you can let them float like independent windows.  This is particularly useful for the crop and 
rotate tools; you can make the Parameters window bigger to more easily work these tools.</p>

<p>Running, rawproc looks like this:</p>

<p>There is also a status bar that will display useful feedback as you work with images, as well as the
display zoom ratio.</p>
