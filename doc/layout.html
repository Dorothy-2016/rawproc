<h2 id="LayoftherawprocLand">Lay of the rawproc Land</h2>

<p>When started, rawproc will present you with a window containing four panes:</p><br>

<ol>
	<li><b>Display:</b> The right-hand window, contains the image being manipulated.  There is also a thumbnail 
	window in the top-left corner; if the image size is greater than the display panel, the thumbnail will
	also contain a viewport rectangle that can be dragged to pan the display image.
	You can toggle the thumb visibility by double-clicking in the thumb.  For the 
	display image, you can zoom in or out of the image in 5% increments using the mousewheel, or toggle 
	100%/fit-to-display by double-clicking the image.  The min/max zoom is presently 10%/500%.<br><br>
	Display pane keyboard commands:
	<ul>
		<li>o: Toggle out-of-bound tone flagging, off|average|at-least-one-channel.  Must be enabled with display.outofbound=1.</li>
		<li>s: Toggle soft-proof.  A proofing profile needs to be specified in display.cms.softproof.profile.</li>
		<li>t: Toggle thumbnail visibility.</li>
		<li>ctrl-c: Copy the float RGB values of the pixel under the mouse pointer to the clipboard.</li>
		<li>shift-mousewheel: Increase the zoom increment to 10%.</li>
		<li>ctrl-mousewheel: Increase the zoom increment to 100%.</li>
	</ul><br><br>
	As of version 0.9, the input.cms property is removed.  Instead, display.cms enables/disables transform of the 
	image from the checked tool to the display profile before rendering in the display pane.  The internal working
	image has to have an attached profile, and an appropriate profile has to be entered in display.cms.displayprofile.
	This change is in response to the realization that there is no global "color management" mode in rawproc; it all
	depends of the "chain of custody" maintained by having the associated profile as metadata to the image that is
	encoded to its constraints.  In rawproc, that is maintained through use of the associated input.*.profile parameters
	that assign a profile to an image when the file is opened, and the application of the colorspace tool as the tool
	chain is built by the user.
	</li><br>

	<li><b>Commands:</b> The top-left-hand window, contains the list of tools applied to the image.  You
	can select a tool to mess with by left-clicking it.  Right-clicking a tool 
	brings up a pop-up menu from which you can either display EXIF and image data or delete the
	tool. The checkbox beside each tool is to
	select that tool result for display; this can be done separate from selecting the tool to
	mess with its parameters.  This is extremely useful to compare the results of different tools,
	as the display is switched from image to image without having to reprocess, at the expense of
	memory.  It works well for 16MP images, but I'm not sure how it'll scale to larger ones.<br><br>
	Command pane keyboard commands:
	<ul>
		<li>ctrl-c: Copies the selected comand and its parameters to the clipboard.</li>
		<li>ctrl-x: Cuts the selected command and its parameters from the list, puts them in the clipboard.</li>
		<li>ctrl-v: Pastes the command/parameters in the clipboard to the list, after the selected command.</li>
	</ul>
	</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Histogram:</b> Standard RGB histogram.  It can be zoomed in with the mouse thumbwheel, and panned
	by dragging with the mouse. Double-clicking the histogram restores the original scale and origin. 
	The default scale is 256 bins; this can be changed with the 
	histogram.scale parameter in the Properties list, for instance, to set 65536 for sixteen-bit 
	scaling. Note that the default of 256 supports the curve tool, which works on a 0-255 range. 
	if you change the histogram tool scaling, the curve tool will still work internally at 0.0-255.0.<br><br>
	Histogram pane keyboard commands:
	<ul>
		<li>l: Pan the histogram left.</li>
		<li>r: Pan the histogram right.</li>
		<li>t: Restores the histogram scale and origin.</li>
		<li>spacebar: Toggles the channel display order.</li>
		<li>ctrl-c: Copies the histogram data as 256 buckets to the clipboard, in the form "red:0val,1val,2val...\ngreen:...\nblue:..."</li>
	</ul>
	</li><br>

	<li><b>Parameters:</b> The bottom-left-hand window, contains the tools for changing the tool 
	selected in the Commands pane.  These are mostly sliders that you can manipulate with either
	a mouse or a touchscreen implement (stylus, or your finger).  Most tools have a reset button.  
	</li><br>
</ol>

<p>You can drag the Commands and Parameters windows from their initial positions and dock them to various sides of the 
rawproc window, or you can let them float like independent windows.  This is particularly useful for the crop and 
rotate tools; you can make the Parameters window bigger to more easily work these tools.</p>

<p>Running, rawproc looks like this:</p>

<p>There is also a status bar that will display useful feedback as you work with images, as well as the
display zoom ratio.</p>
