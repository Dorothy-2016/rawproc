<p>Use to correct red-eye.  This implemention requires more manual intervention than most, but the 
results are fairly pleasing.  For each pixel, the algorithm first checks to see if the red value is 
at least 1.5 times the average of the green and blue values.  If so, it then replaces the red value
with the average of the green and blue values.  This transform helps to preserve highlights in the eyes.
There are color spaces for which this algorithm produces a green cast; if this is encountered, the
desaturate option provides a suitable transformation alternative.</p>
<p>Use of the tool first requires zooming to 100%; double-clicking the display will eventually toggle 
to it.  Then, the eye centers are selected directly in the display with the mouse; the selections are
marked with a cross.  There are threshold and radius sliders to control the process, as well as a 
percent for the desaturate if selected.  Follow the instructions in the tool parameters box.</p>
