<h3 id="Resize">Resize</h3>
<p>Resizes the image to the specified dimensions using the selected algorithm.  Note that the bit-depth is not changed.  
The default of 640x0
resizes the image to preserve the original aspect ratio with a width of 640; 0 in either parameter tells the tool
to maintain aspect ratio.  The default rescale algorithm was selected for good results; one might mess with 
catmullrom and lanczos3 to see if another is preferrable.  The display image is changed when you either hit Enter 
after changing a dimension, or selecting another algorithm</p>

<p>Note: resize is implemented using the FreeImage routine, so it is not multithreaded, and will run slower than other tools.</p>
