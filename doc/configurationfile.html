<h2 id="Configurationfile">Configuration File</h2>
<p>A default rawproc.conf is installed in the appropriate Windows directory.  In it, you'll find a slew of configurable
items, such as the tool defaults, control point sizes, and logging.  You can change these with a text editor, then 
run rawproc to see the changes take effect.  At present, you can't change the configuration while running rawproc; you 
need to make the changes with the editor, then stop and restart rawproc.</p>

<p>If you run rawproc from the command line, you can make a separate rawproc.conf in the working directory and rawproc 
will use it instead of the installed file.</p>
