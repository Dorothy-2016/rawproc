<h2 id="Runningrawproc">Running rawproc</h2>

<p>It's really pretty simple, you can either run rawproc like you would any other program from the Start menu, or double
click the desktop icon.</p>

<p>You can make rawproc a lot easier to get to if you either specify it as the default program for the 
image types you want to work with, or getting it into the list of programs you get when you right-click 
on a file and select "Run With" from the popup menu.  Both Windows File Explorer and Nautilus in Ubuntu 
have a "Run With" menu entry that allows this.</p>

<p>If you put the rawproc install directory in your PATH environment variable, you can run rawproc from 
the command line: 

<pre>rawproc DSC_0001.NEF</pre>

will run rawproc and open the image file specified.</p>

<p>The -s switch is a unique rawproc feature.  If you've previously created an image with rawproc, it'll
save the command sequence used to create it in the image's EXIF.  Using -s to open the image will actually
open the image you started with (if it finds it in the same directory), and apply the tools in sequence to 
reproduce the image you intended to open:

<pre>rawproc -s DSC_0001.jpg</pre>

If DSC_0001.jpg was created by rawproc from DSC_0001.NEF, this command will open the .NEF file and apply 
the tools in sequence to recreate DSC_0001.jpg.
