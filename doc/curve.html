<h3 id="Curve">Curve</h3>
<p>Allows definition of a tone curve to apply as a lookup table to the image, the classic curve tool.  Click on
the curve to add a control point, drag it to where you want.  Click on a control point to select it, it 
turns red.  Double-click the selected point to delete it (you can't delete the end points).  When you move 
a control point, the lookup table is applied when you release the mouse button.</p>
<p>If you select a point, you can drag your mouse (or finger on a touchscreen) anywhere in the pane to move it; you don't have 
to be touching the point directly.  You can also double-click anywhere in the curve pane to delete the selected point, 
holdover behavior from when I was trying to implement a touch interface.</p>

<p>Note that you can move the endpoints on the top and bottom lines to adjust the black and white point, so
you could do that without resorting to the black/white point tool.</p>
<p>You can add as many curve tools to the command list as you desire.  Sometimes, doing something like using a curve 
to adjust contrast doesn't leave enough slope to do any other manipulations; just add another curve tool and go from there.</p>
