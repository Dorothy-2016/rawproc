<h2 id="img">img Command Line Image Processor</h2>

<p>img is a command line image processor, in the way of ImageMagick and G'MIC.  It simply
provides a command line interface to the gimage library, exposing the tools with commands 
that look like this:</p>

<pre>img DSG_0001.NEF gamma:2.2 blackwhitepoint resize:640,0 sharpen:1 DSG_0001.jpg</pre>

<p>which opens the NEF, applies gamma, auto-adjusted black/white point, resize preserving
aspect ratio, just a bit of sharpen, and saves to a JPEG.  If you compiled rawproc, you 
probably compiled gimage first; img is the same program as gimg from gimage.  In the 
Windows installers, you are queried regarding adding the path to img to the PATH variable;
if you intend to use img, that's a good idea.</p>

<p>The available commands in img can be seen by running img with no arguments.  img has a
couple of batch tricks worth mentioning here:</p>

<ul>

<li>Wild card processing: The "*" character can be used in input and output file names to apply
the same processing to a batch of files:
<pre>img "*.NEF" gamma:2.2 blackwhitepoint "processed/*.jpg"</pre><br>
This command will process each of the .NEFs in the current directory and save a correspondingly-named 
JPEG in the processed/ directory.  Note the quotes, this keeps the shell from expanding the filenames itself.</li><br>
<li>Incremental processing: img will skip an input file if the corresponding output file already 
exists.  This is handy for processing a set of images, and later coming back with the same SD card
and processing the new images shot since the first run.  There's no command line switch, img just 
does that all the time.  So, if you want to reprocess an image, you have to delete or move the 
previously generated output image.</li><br>

</ul>
