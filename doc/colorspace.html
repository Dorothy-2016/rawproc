<h3 id="Colorspace">Colorspace</h3>
<p>The edit box accepts a .icc file name, which is then used either to transform the image from the 
previous colorspace to the new one (convert) or to attach the profile to the image as a representation 
of its current colorspace (assign).  Either a full file path name can be specified, or just a filename, 
in which case the cms.profilepath property is consulted for the path.</p>

<p>The "Select Profile" button opens a file selector on the directory specified in cms.profilepath.  If a profile is selected
from this directory, the command will include only the filename; if the selector is switched to a different directory, the command
will include the full path of the profile.</p>

<p>The Rendering Intent selection allows one to choose the algorithm used to handle conversion of 
out-of-gamut colors.  Note that not all profiles allow use of all rendering intents; the LittleCMS 
documentation should be consulted for guidance on an informed selection.
