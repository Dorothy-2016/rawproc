<h3 id="Colorspace">Colorspace</h3>
<p>The edit box accepts a .icc file name, which is then used either to transform the image from the 
previous colorspace to the new one (apply) or to attach the profile to the image as a representation of its current colorspace (assign).</p>

<p>The "Select Profile" button opens a file selector on the directory specified in cms.profilepath.  If a profile is selected
from this directory, the command will include only the filename; if the selector is switched to a different directory, the command
will include the full path of the profile.</p>
