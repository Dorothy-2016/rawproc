<h3 id="Colorspace">Colorspace</h3>
<p>The edit box accepts a .icc file name, which is then used to transform the image from the 
previous colorspace to the new one.  Use this to set a working colorspace to a raw image loaded
with its camera profile.</p>

<p>Later versions will allow the profile to be assigned or applied.</p>
