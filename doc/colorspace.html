<h3 id="Colorspace">Colorspace</h3>

<p>Purpose: This tool is used to either assign a color profile to an image, or to convert the image from its
current colorspace to a new one.  This tool has two modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>profile file:</b> The edit box accepts a file name, which is then used either to transform the image from the 
previous colorspace to the new one (convert) or to attach the profile to the image as a representation 
of its current colorspace (assign).  Either a full file path name can be specified, or just a filename, 
in which case the cms.profilepath property is consulted for the path.

<p>The file can be either 1) an ICC color profile (.icc), either V2 or V4; 2) a JSON file (.json) in the format defined by Anders Torger
in his dcamprof software (https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~torger/dcamprof.html); 3) a comma-separated list of nine integer numbers 
that specify D65 color primaries in the form used in David Coffin's dcraw program.

<p>The "Select Profile" button opens a file selector on the directory specified in cms.profilepath.  If a profile is selected
from this directory, the command will include only the filename; if the selector is switched to a different directory, the command
will include the full path of the profile.</p>

<p>The Rendering Intent selection allows one to choose the algorithm used to handle conversion of 
out-of-gamut colors.  Note that not all profiles allow use of all rendering intents; the LittleCMS 
documentation should be consulted for guidance on an informed selection.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>assign camera profile:</b>  This mode will use the image metadata camera make and model to look up a set of dcraw-style 
color primaries from dcraw.c, or RawTherapee's camconst.json, in that order.  Either or both of these files will be searched for
in the following directories in this order: 1) the pathname specified in tool.colorspace.*path, where '*' is either dcraw or camconst, 2) the
directory containing the rawproc executable, 3) the OS-specific application configuration path (same place as rawproc.conf).
If the image metadata contains a camera make/model, it will be displayed in the tool pane.  If one needs to determine if and/or where
the dcraw.c and camconst.json files are found, clicking the 'list' button in the tool pane will produce such a report dialog.

<p>If a set of primaries are found, they will be displayed at the bottom of the tool pane.</p>

</li>
</ul>
